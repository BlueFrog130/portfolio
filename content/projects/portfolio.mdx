## Overview

This portfolio website is an exploration of building a modern React application from scratch, intentionally avoiding meta-frameworks like Next.js or Remix. The goal was to deeply understand the underlying technologies and patterns that these frameworks abstract away.

## Architecture Decisions

### No Meta-Framework

Rather than reaching for Next.js or similar, this project implements:

- **Custom Router**: A lightweight routing solution with View Transitions API support
- **Static Site Generation**: Build-time rendering for optimal performance
- **Server Components**: Leveraging React 19's RSC capabilities without a framework

### View Transitions API

The site uses the native View Transitions API to create smooth page transitions, providing a polished user experience without heavy animation libraries.

### MDX for Content

Project content and descriptions are authored in MDX, allowing for rich content with embedded components while keeping the authoring experience simple.

## Technical Stack

- **React 19**: Latest React features including Server Components
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the codebase
- **Vite**: Fast development server and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid UI development

## Lessons Learned

Building this portfolio reinforced several key insights:

- Understanding what meta-frameworks provide by implementing it manually
- The power and simplicity of the View Transitions API
- React Server Components can work outside of meta-frameworks
- The value of static site generation for content-focused sites
