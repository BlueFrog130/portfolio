## Overview

CodingStub is a full-stack online coding environment developed during my time as a Graduate Assistant at the University of South Dakota. The platform allows students to practice coding problems in a secure, isolated environment.

## Technical Architecture

The application leverages containerized microservices to provide a secure and scalable solution for running untrusted student code. Each code execution request spins up an isolated Docker container, preventing malicious code from affecting the host system or other users.

### Key Components

- **Frontend**: React-based interface with real-time code editing and output streaming
- **API Gateway**: Node.js service handling authentication and request routing
- **Execution Engine**: Containerized code runners supporting multiple languages
- **Problem Management**: Admin interface for creating and managing coding challenges

## Lessons Learned

Building CodingStub taught me valuable lessons about:

- Designing secure systems for executing untrusted code
- Managing container orchestration and resource limits
- Building real-time applications with WebSocket connections
- Scaling microservices architecture for educational use cases
