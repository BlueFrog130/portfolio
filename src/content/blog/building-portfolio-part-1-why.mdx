## The Meta-Framework Landscape

The JavaScript ecosystem in 2024/2025 offers an embarrassment of riches when it comes to React frameworks:

- **Remix** with its focus on web fundamentals
- **TanStack Start** emerging as a promising alternative
- **Astro** for content-heavy sites

So why would anyone choose to build their own?
