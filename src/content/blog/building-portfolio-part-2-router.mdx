# Building a Custom React Router

## Why Build a Router?

When you hear "build your own router," you might think it's unnecessary complexity. But there are compelling reasons:

- **Control over transitions** - The ViewTransition API changes everything
- **Simpler mental model** - No framework magic to understand
- **Tight integration** - Analytics, preloading, exactly how you want it

## Pattern Matching

The foundation of any router is pattern matching. Here's how we handle dynamic routes like `/projects/:slug`:

```typescript
// TODO: Add matchPath implementation
```

## React 19's startTransition

*TODO: Explain how startTransition enables smoother navigations*

## ViewTransition API Integration

*TODO: Show how ViewTransitions create smooth page transitions*

## Hash Navigation

*TODO: Discuss hash links and smooth scrolling*

## Suspense and Lazy Loading

*TODO: Cover lazy-loaded routes with Suspense boundaries*

## SSR/SSG Considerations

*TODO: Discuss initial path hydration*

## The Full Implementation

*TODO: Walk through the complete Router and RouterProvider*

## Alternatives Considered

- **React Router v6/v7** - Full-featured but more than needed
- **TanStack Router** - Type-safe but adds complexity
- **Wouter** - Minimal, was a close second
